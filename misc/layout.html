  <p>
    Subheadings are an effective way to present information to readers, especially in lengthy articles, as they help summarize content in a meaningful way. Subheadings should give enough information to the reader so they can glance to see if the information they are looking exists without having to read the whole article. Subheadings also help writers as they can used an outline so no information is repeated.
