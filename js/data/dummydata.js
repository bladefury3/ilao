The 120-day period starts with the first day the client goes into a medical institution. When a client is admitted to a long term care facility from a hospital, the 120-day count begins with the date of admission to the hospital. A move from the hospital to a long term care facility, or from a long term care facility to a hospital, does not interrupt the 120-day count.
