## HTML
To add a new page, follow the steps below in order.

1. Add a navigation item to the index.html page.
2. Create the page based on one of the files from the layouts, folder.
3. Save the .html page file in the layouts folder to use if you need to do any future edits.
4. Lastly, go to "https://kangax.github.io/html-minifier/" for minifying the HTML file you just created.
5. Convert any "single quotes" to &apos; in the minified file.
6. Go to js/data/dummydata.js, at the end of last entry add a "comma".
7. Add the name of your Navigation item, make sure it is exactly the same.
8. For instance, "Hello": 'minified <html> goes here'.
9. That's it, and now you can publish the page and the ajax will load it.
10. If things don't work, right click on the page and go to inspect element.
11. Debug from there.
